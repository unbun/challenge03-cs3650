# Running the FS:
  - `make` 
  	- creates nufstool and nufsmount
  - `./nufstool new data.nufs`
  	creates new disk image (1 MB disk image)
  - `make mount`
  	- runs nufsmount with data.nufs
  	- mounts and logs the disk
  - open another terminal
  	- run the sys calls
  	- nufsmount terminal will show the logs
  	- `make unmount` to close mount
  - `./nufstool ls data.nufs`
  	- inspects unmounted data.nufs




# File System Layout:

  - 1MB = 256 pages (4k blocks)
  - page 0 = 256 inodes (each 8 bytes) 
  	- an array of inodes (for getting inodes)
  	
  - page 1 & inode 1 = root directory
	  - the root directory is just an array of 128 char[16]'s
	    - max filename length = 15
	    - ent[0] == '\0' means unused

  - That leaves inodes/blocks #2 - #255 for file
